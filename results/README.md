Detailed file descriptions
--------

**Supplementary File SF1. Data dictionary for all variables used in multiple imputation.** Summary information about all baseline variables collected from the UK Biobank that were used in multiple imputation after variable exclusions. Information includes variable name used in analysis, UK Biobank field ID, original variable name in UK Biobank dataset provided to us, and URL link for each variable to the corresponding webpage on the UK Biobank showcase giving extensive detail for each variable. 

**Supplementary File SF2. Data dictionary for exposome variables used in XWAS analyses.** Summary information about all exposome analyzed in the mortality XWAS, including the sex-specific reproduction factors analyzed in the sex-specific XWAS only. Information includes variable name used in analysis, UK Biobank field ID, original variable name in UK Biobank dataset provided to us, and URL link for each variable to the corresponding webpage on the UK Biobank showcase giving extensive detail for each variable.

**Supplementary File SF3. Female XWAS output.** We report all female-specific XWAS summary statistics. All effect estimates (hazard ratios, confidence intervals) shown are for analyses in the discovery set (n = 118,815). FDR corrected p-values are given for both the discovery and replication analyses (FDR p-values will be NA for variables with an FDR p-value ≥ 0.05 in the discovery analysis, as these variables would not have been tested in the replication stage).

**Supplementary File SF4. Male XWAS output.** We report all male-specific XWAS summary statistics. All effect estimates (hazard ratios, confidence intervals) shown are for analyses in the discovery set (n = 99,631). FDR corrected p-values are given for both the discovery and replication analyses (FDR p-values will be NA for variables with an FDR p-value ≥ 0.05 in the discovery analysis, as these variables would not have been tested in the replication stage).

**Supplementary File SF5. Pooled XWAS output.** We report all XWAS summary statistics from the final pooled XWAS. All effect estimates (hazard ratios, confidence intervals) shown are for analyses in the discovery set (n = 218,446). FDR corrected p-values are given for both the discovery and replication analyses (FDR p-values will be NA for variables with an FDR p-value ≥ 0.05 in the discovery analysis, as these variables would not have been tested in the replication stage).

**Supplementary File SF6. Disease interaction sensitivity output.** We report all summary statistics from the disease sensitivity analysis conducted among UK Biobank participants where an interaction term was added between each exposure and a binary indicator of poor health at baseline. All effect estimates (hazard ratios, confidence intervals) shown are for analyses in the pooled dataset (n = 436,891). 

**Supplementary Files SF7-SF31. Aging biomarker analysis output.** We report all summary statistics from the aging biomarker analysis testing associations between 25 blood biomarkers and exposome variables still significant after cluster multivariable and disease sensitivity analyses (n = 436,891).

**Supplementary Files SF32-SF59. Incident disease and cardiometabolic risk factor analysis output.** We report all summary statistics from the incident chronic disease and clinical risk factor analysis testing associations between all 28 diseases/risk factors and exposome variables still significant after cluster multivariable and disease sensitivity analyses (n = 436,891).
